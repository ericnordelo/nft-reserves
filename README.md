## NFT Reserval

OWNER:
-  Whitelist asset to be open to receive Reserval Offers. He may (start with his own initial offer). IMPORTANT: if the owner sets an offer you get only the approval of the Owner ffor the NFT to the contract but the NFT is NOT LOCKED at this stage
-  Owner can remove from whitelist without any cost as long as no offer has been accepted first.
-  Owner can accept an offer. At this stage NFT is locked on the contract
-  (modified, can't withdraw) Owner can withdraw collateral deposited by the buyer at any moment
-  If owner wants to cancel the Reserval (Reserval), he needs to payback what he withdrawn +a fee
BUYER:
-  Buyer can set offers for whitelisted NFTs. IMPORTANT: the offer does not lock the collateral of the buyer. It only gets the proposal for that toekns aand amoiunt to the contrract. For example if i propose 10K SHIB, I approve the contract but i do not lock them.
-  Buyer can reserve NFT directly if the owner has some offer
-  Buyer needs to keep a level of collateral. Otherwise can be liquidaated and lose it.
-  If collateral goes below the ratio, buyer needs to deposit more collateral.
-  At future (expiration) the buyer needs to pay the Reserve Price within a period of 5 days max. If not, he loses the Reserval of buying
